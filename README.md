# Railway-Crack-Detection-Using-ML
 Objective:
To detect cracks or fractures on railway tracks using ML techniques, aiming to prevent derailments and ensure safer train operations.
Dataset:
Images of railway tracks (with and without cracks).

Public datasets are rare; most use custom datasets captured during inspections.
Tools & Technologies:
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch

Raspberry Pi (for real-time embedded systems)

GPS module (to log crack locations
Output:
Detection of crack.

Alerts for maintenance.

Can be integrated with railway signaling systems.
