**# Railway-Crack-Detection-Using-ML**

**Objective:**
 
To detect cracks or fractures on railway tracks using ML techniques, aiming to prevent derailments and ensure safer train operations.

**Dataset:**
1) Images of railway tracks (with and without cracks).
2) Public datasets are rare; most use custom datasets captured during inspections.
  Tools & Technologies:
  *  Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch
  * Raspberry Pi (for real-time embedded systems)
  * GPS module (to log crack locations
   
**Output:**
* Detection of crack.
* Alerts for maintenance.
* Can be integrated with railway signaling systems.

**Benefits:**
* Real-time monitoring.
* Reduces manual inspection effort.
* Prevents accidents by early detection.
* Saves cost in long-term maintenance.
